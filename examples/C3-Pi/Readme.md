# Parallel Monte Carlo estimation of Pi

Again, just a single-file application, with no dependencies. Just to illustrate how easy it is to do parallel computing with Scala.

Note however, that parallel collections are slightly different in Scala 2.13, so you need to make sure you run this under Scala 2.12 (or 2.11).
