# Regression modelling

Illustration of how to implement regression modelling "from scratch" in Scala. Contains some useful techniques for those interested in statistical computing and numerical algorithms development.

For "real" regression analysis projects, you'll want to use a library, such as [scala-glm](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-glm) or, more likely, [smile](http://haifengl.github.io/), or for "big data", [Spark MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/).
