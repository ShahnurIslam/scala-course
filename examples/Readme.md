# Examples
## A collection of complete runnables examples

Each subdirectory of this directory contains a complete runnable Scala program, numbered according to the Chapter of the notes that they most closely relate to. It should be possible to run most of these directly from the command line of the relevant directory by typing `sbt run` at the OS command prompt.

Note that there is a separate Readme in each directory, and that these contain further details specific to each example.
