# Testing stochastic simulation from a Gamma distribution

Simple example of how to test a non-uniform random number generation scheme.

Note that this a proper `sbt` project template layout, so navigate around to see where everything is, ideally before you do `sbt run`, and then again after, to see the additional files that `sbt` generates.

Note that we will consider proper testing frameworks later, including both unit-testing and property-based testing frameworks.
