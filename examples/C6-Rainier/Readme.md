# Rainier

Simple example of using [Rainier](https://rainier.fit/) to do Bayesian logistic regression on some synthetic data. It should just `sbt run`. Work through the Rainier documentation for further information.

Note that this example also illustrates the use of `mdoc` for producing reports. This includes the use of EvilPlot figures generated by Rainier diagnostics. An [example report](docs/LogisticRegression.md) is provided, and the [generated Markdown document](target/mdoc/LogisticRegression.md) includes generated output and plots.
