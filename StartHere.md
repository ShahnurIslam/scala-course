# Start Here

## Main jump-off page for the Scala for Statistical Computing and Data Science Short Course

Course participants should bookmark this page: https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course/blob/master/StartHere.md

* [Course outline](README.md) - front page of the repo, with brief summary overview
* [Setup instructions](Setup.md) - details of how to set up your laptop for programming in Scala. Please follow these instructions carefully *in advance of the start of the course*.

Registered course participants should not print the [**course notes**](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course/raw/master/scscala.pdf), as a printed copy of the latest version will be given to participants at the start of the course. Others are welcome to self-study this course - please see the [self-study guide](SelfStudyGuide.md). Use the hashtag `#scscala` for discussing the course and the course notes on Twitter and other social media platforms.

* [Useful links](UsefulLinks.md) - selective and curated collection of some important additional on-line resources
* [app-template](app-template/) - Scala sbt "seed" project, for copying and editing to create a new Scala sbt project. Minimal dependencies in the sbt build file (just Breeze). However, if you have an internet connection, it is typically better to use `sbt new darrenjw/breeze.g8` to create new project, as described in the notes.
* [sbt-test](sbt-test/) - simple Scala sbt project with lots of dependencies. See the [build.sbt](sbt-test/build.sbt) for list of dependencies. Primarily for testing correct installation of sbt and caching of commonly required dependencies. Also useful for spinning up a REPL (`sbt console`) with lots of dependencies for interactive experiments. The [src/test](sbt-test/src/test/scala/) subdirectory tree contains some basic examples of how to write test code.

* [Fragments](fragments/Readme.md) - raw fragments of code from the course notes, auto-extracted by chapter
* [Examples](examples/) - complete runnable code examples, split corresponding to each chapter of the course notes
* [Exercises](exercises/Readme.md) - simple programming exercises, to be tackled following the presentation of each chapter of the notes.
